        <h2>Personal Background</h2>
        <p>
          First, thank you for visiting my site; I appreciate your interest in
          me and my work! I currently reside in Islip, NY, USAand was born and
          raised on Long Island, NY. Moving into the software engineering
          industry will be my third, and hopefully final, career transition.
          Previously, I was a musician and music educator, and I am currently a
          Buyer and Sub-Contracts Administrator in Supply Chain.
        </p>
        <p>
          I attended three different schools for four and a half years, majoring
          in Music Education and Music Performance before leaving without a
          degree. The last school I was at wanted another four years out of me,
          and I saw the pile of student loan debt continuing to grow, so I
          decided to drop out; more on that later.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have built websites and small projects mainly for myself; however, I
          have also built websites for a couple of clients. The only one still
          in business is <a

            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
          >
            Gregory K. Williams</a
          >, a violist and violinist whom I studied under in my former life as a
          musician.

        <h2>My Journey</h2>
        <h3>Music</h3>
        <Image src={musicPicture} alt="Row of string instruments." />
        <p>
          As previously mentioned, my first career, passion, and love was, and
          forever will be, music. I started playing viola when I was eight years
          old and simply stuck with it as I had natural talent; what kid doesn't
          like doing something because they are good at it? However, it did not
          take more than two or three years to realize I wanted to do something
          with music for the rest of my life.
        </p>
        <p>
          At age fifteen, I began performing professionally at local musical
          theatres and weddings around Long Island. I would continue to do so
          until around thirty years old when my scope increased from only Long
          Island to the tri-state area (New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut).
        </p>
        <p>
          When I dropped out of college in 2013, I went on to manage a couple of
          local music stores while continuing to perform professionally and
          teach private music lessons. However, there came a time when I
          realized that I was not making enough money and needed to change
          courses. That is when I transitioned into Procurement.
        </p>
        <h3>Procurement</h3>
        <Image
          src={procurementPicture}
          alt="Rows of cubicles in a corporate office building."
        />
        <p>
          On March 16, 2020 - the same day most of the world shut down from
          COVID-19, I started my first job as a Buyer at a government
          contractor. This was a completely new industry for me; I never heard
          of people buying items for a company for a living before! Due to the
          pandemic, I had to learn this new job remotely, which was new for me
          and the company. I did well, and within 1.5 years, I got a small
          promotion.
        </p>
        <p>
          While this felt great, this career was not for me for the long haul; I
          was not passionate about it and wanted change. I was at “Company A”
          from March 2020 - March 2022, where I went to another government
          contractor as a Buyer. I was only there from March 22 - January 2023
          for various reasons, mainly due to an incredibly unrealistic and
          unmanageable workload that was wreaking havoc on my mental health.
        </p>
        <p>
          That leads us to where I am today: back at “Company A.” Returning to
          this company, I received another small promotion from Buyer to
          Sub-Contracts Administrator. I have had a lot of growth in this field
          since 2020. however, I still can't help but feel like it is not for me
          in the long run.
        </p>
        <h3>Web Development</h3>
        <Image src={webdevPicture} alt=`14" MacBook Pro in Space Black` />
        <p>
          It was late 2019 when I decided to start studying programming for a
          career change; however, even that decision wasn't without its twists
          and turns. I started studying Front-End Web Development, then learning
          to be an AWS Solutions Architect, and then studying to take the
          CompTIA A+ exam for a career in IT before circling back to Front-End
          Web Development.
        </p>
        <p>Why did I choose Front-End Web Development?I just love it!</p>
        <p>
          It allows me to flex the creative muscles of my brain with design
          choices while letting me program - something I've always been
          interested in.
        </p>
        <p>
          My learning path has been through its ups and downs as well. Being
          self-taught, I had only myself to depend on, and that lack of
          structure sometimes hindered me. Learning on my own was completely new
          to me; whether it was a lack of discipline, running on motivation
          until it ran out, life getting in the way, or my indecisiveness on
          what to focus on and how to learn it, my progress learning has ebbed
          and flowed in the last few years. This was by no means a result of a
          lack of passion or interest, but just being overwhelmed at times.

        <h2>My Goals, Mission, and Values</h2>
        <h3>My Current Goal</h3>
        <p>
          Obtain a job as a Front-End Web Developer. I want to be happy in my
          career again and stick with it for life.
        </p>
        <h3>My End Goal</h3>
        <p>
          Become a Full-Stack Engineer. I look forward to learning back-end
          technologies to expand my projects, build at least one successful
          SaaS, and provide more value to clients and companies.
        </p>
        <h3>My Mission</h3>
        <p>
          To help people and companies build the web presence they deserve
          through quality websites, apps, and services.
        </p>
        <h3>My Values</h3>
        <h4>Inclusivity</h4>
        <p>
          Everyone deserves the same treatment, circumstances, and allowances.
          Inclusivity in websites means ensuring accessibility is a primary
          focus rather than an afterthought.
        </p>
        <h4>Educating Others</h4>
        <p>
          This harkens back to my days as a music teacher. However, to truly
          understand a concept and claim how to do something, you must be able
          to teach it. Not only that, I want to give back to the Web Development
          community that has given so much to me; one way to do that is by
          sharing my knowledge
        </p>
        <h4>Collaboration</h4>
        <p>
          While I often like working on my own, there is no denying that you can
          achieve much more by working with others. Whether it's bouncing ideas
          off friends in a Discord server, reaching out to the X (formerly
          Twitter) world, or attending local Meetups, I believe we can all
          progress faster by working together.
        </p>
        <h4>Kindness</h4>
        <p>
          I was raised by a few golden rules, and one of those was “Treat others
          how you want to be treated.” I try to live by this every single day.
        </p>
        <h4>Bringing Others Up</h4>
        <p>
          I believe in bringing others up rather than putting them down. That
          means being there for friends and family, helping people in need,
          encouraging them to continue their journey, and much more. There is so
          much negativity in this world, and if I can try to lessen that in any
          person's life, then I can rest easy.
